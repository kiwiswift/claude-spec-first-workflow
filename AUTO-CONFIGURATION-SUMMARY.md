# Auto-Configuration Summary

## Overview

The Specification-First workflow now features **intelligent auto-configuration** that makes it truly zero-config while maintaining full customizability.

## Your Questions Answered

### 1. Who creates steering documents?

**Answer: BOTH - Agent auto-creates, User can customize**

- **First time use**: Agent automatically creates them
- **Anytime**: User can edit the markdown files
- **Guided setup**: User can run `/setup-steering` for interactive configuration

### 2. Is there a command for creating them?

**Answer: YES - `/setup-steering`**

Three ways to create steering documents:

1. **Automatic** (recommended): Just run `/spec` or `/implement`
   - Agent detects steering docs missing
   - Auto-creates based on project detection
   - Continues with your task

2. **Guided Interactive**: `/setup-steering`
   - Asks questions about your project
   - Creates customized steering docs
   - Full control over all settings

3. **Quick Modes**:
   - `/setup-steering --quick` - Auto-create with defaults
   - `/setup-steering --from-claude-md` - Extract from CLAUDE.md

### 3. What happens when agent doesn't find steering docs?

**Answer: Agent auto-creates them intelligently**

**Process**:
```
1. Agent checks for steering documents
   ‚Üì
2. NOT FOUND ‚Üí Auto-create mode
   ‚Üì
3. Detect project:
   - Read package.json (TypeScript/JavaScript)
   - Read pyproject.toml (Python)
   - Read go.mod (Go)
   - Read CLAUDE.md (if exists)
   - Check configs (TypeScript, ESLint, test framework)
   ‚Üì
4. Create steering documents:
   - quality-standards.md (based on detected stack)
   - architecture-principles.md (based on CLAUDE.md or defaults)
   ‚Üì
5. Announce creation:
   - Show what was detected
   - Show what was created
   - Suggest customization
   ‚Üì
6. Continue with /spec or /implement
```

**Example Output**:
```
‚öôÔ∏è Setting up steering documents...

I detected this is a TypeScript/React/Next.js project with:
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint configuration
- Jest testing
- Clean Architecture (from CLAUDE.md)

I've created steering documents based on your project:
‚úÖ quality-standards.md (TypeScript + ESLint + Jest requirements)
‚úÖ architecture-principles.md (Clean Architecture A- grade)

üìù These documents now control all quality gates and standards.

Please review and customize:
  .claude/workflows/spec-first/steering/quality-standards.md
  .claude/workflows/spec-first/steering/architecture-principles.md

Or run: /setup-steering for guided interactive setup

Continuing with specification creation...
```

## How It Works

### Auto-Detection Strategy

**For TypeScript/JavaScript Projects**:
1. Read `package.json`
   - Detect: Next.js, React, TypeScript, test framework
2. Read `tsconfig.json`
   - Detect: Strict mode, compiler options
3. Read `.eslintrc.*`
   - Detect: Linting rules and plugins
4. Read `CLAUDE.md`
   - Extract: Quality standards, architecture principles

**For Python Projects**:
1. Read `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
   - Detect: FastAPI, Django, pytest, mypy
2. Read `pyproject.toml` (ruff/black config)
   - Detect: Linting and formatting settings
3. Read `CLAUDE.md`
   - Extract: Quality standards, architecture principles

**For Go Projects**:
1. Read `go.mod`
   - Detect: Go version, frameworks
2. Check for standard Go tools
   - Detect: go vet, golangci-lint
3. Read `CLAUDE.md`
   - Extract: Quality standards, architecture principles

### Intelligent Defaults

Based on detection, agent creates appropriate steering docs:

**Example: TypeScript/React/Next.js Project**
```markdown
## Quality Gates

### Type Checking
- TypeScript: 0 errors (strict mode)
- No 'any' types allowed

### Linting
- ESLint: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Testing
- Jest: 100% passing
- Coverage: Maintained or improved

### Build
- Next.js build: Must succeed
```

**Example: Python/FastAPI Project**
```markdown
## Quality Gates

### Type Checking
- mypy: 0 errors (strict mode)

### Linting
- ruff: 0 errors

### Testing
- pytest: 100% passing
- Coverage: 90% minimum

### Build
- Python package: Must build
```

## Customization Options

### Option 1: Edit Markdown Files Directly

```bash
# Navigate to steering docs
cd .claude/workflows/spec-first/steering/

# Edit with your editor
vim quality-standards.md
vim architecture-principles.md
```

### Option 2: Use /setup-steering (Interactive)

```bash
/setup-steering
```

Agent asks questions and creates customized docs.

### Option 3: Extract from CLAUDE.md

```bash
/setup-steering --from-claude-md
```

Agent reads your CLAUDE.md and extracts standards.

### Option 4: Quick Defaults

```bash
/setup-steering --quick
```

Agent creates sensible defaults without asking questions.

## For TrackSmart (This Project)

‚úÖ **Already configured!**

We created steering documents manually:
- `quality-standards.md` - TrackSmart-specific gates
- `architecture-principles.md` - Clean Architecture A- requirements

When you run `/spec` or `/implement`:
```
‚úÖ Using project steering documents:
- quality-standards.md (last updated: 2025-10-19)
- architecture-principles.md (last updated: 2025-10-19)

All quality gates and standards will be applied from these documents.

Continuing with specification creation...
```

## For New Projects

When you use this workflow in a different repo:

**First `/spec` or `/implement` run**:
1. Agent checks for steering docs ‚Üí Not found
2. Agent detects your project stack
3. Agent creates steering docs with intelligent defaults
4. Agent announces what was created
5. Agent continues with your task
6. **You can customize later** (or use as-is)

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Zero-config**: Works immediately without manual setup
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent**: Creates appropriate defaults for any stack
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: Always tells you what's happening
- ‚úÖ **Flexible**: User can customize or use guided setup
- ‚úÖ **Never fails**: Graceful fallback to sensible defaults
- ‚úÖ **Portable**: Works across TypeScript, Python, Go, any language

## Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/spec <description>` | Create specification | New task (auto-creates steering if needed) |
| `/implement <task-id>` | Implement from spec | Approved spec (auto-creates steering if needed) |
| `/setup-steering` | Interactive setup | Want full control over configuration |
| `/setup-steering --quick` | Quick defaults | Want defaults without questions |
| `/setup-steering --from-claude-md` | Extract from docs | Have CLAUDE.md with standards |

## Files Created

When steering docs are auto-created or setup:

```
.claude/workflows/spec-first/steering/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quality-standards.md       # Your quality gates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-principles.md # Your architecture rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing-strategy.md        # Your testing requirements (optional)
```

## Version

- **Workflow Version**: 1.2.0 (Auto-Configuration)
- **Previous Version**: 1.1.0 (Enhanced with steering docs)
- **Commit**: cbfcac2
- **Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary

**You don't need to do anything!**

Just run `/spec <description>` and the workflow will:
1. Auto-configure itself for your project
2. Create appropriate steering documents
3. Continue with your task

If you want more control, run `/setup-steering` anytime.

**Ready to use!** Try: `/spec <your problem description>`
